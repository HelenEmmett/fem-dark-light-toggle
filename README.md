## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Using rem values for fonts and breakpoints to allow for text scalability

### What I learned

- How to detect a users preferred colour scheme
- How to utilise local storage to store the state of chosen colour scheme
- Researched the best use of rem, em and pixel sizing, with consideration to accessibility and allowing users to use their browser font settings.

### Continued development

- Understanding HTML semantics
- More understanding of accessibility

### Useful resources / Notes

- [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - This helped me to understand when to use rem, em and pixel sizing. I found the approach of using intuition rather than memorisation a great way to think about it..
- [Toggle Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - I found this really easy to understand, and follow.
- [Gradient Borders](https://codyhouse.co/nuggets/css-gradient-borders) - I thought this was a good approach to solve the issue of adding gradients to a border with border-radius.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to @TheCoderCoder (https://youtu.be/krfUjg0S2uI?si=2moFp_P8fBP3fjjv). Jess explained the javascript and logic very well, and I based my script on her code. I altered the functions, because I'm not yet comfortable with arrow functions. I also wrote my own event listeners, because I didn't quite understand her code.
